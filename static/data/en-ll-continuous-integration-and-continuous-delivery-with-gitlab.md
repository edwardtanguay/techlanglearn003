- year: 2022
- status: only 3 more videos

## intro - 0:57, 2024-10-28

- esta es solo una introducción básica

## what is GitLab - 1:39, 2024-10-28

- GitLab es más una solución de extremo a extremo que GitHub
- te permite reemplazar Jenkins
- el CD rara vez se automatiza

## what problem needs solving - 2:54, 2024-10-29

- Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
  - analysis
  - design
  - development
  - deployment and delivery
  - maintenance

## set up a project - 3:33, 2024-10-31

- me estoy registrando para una cuenta de GitLab.com
- "create blank project": gitlabcicd-showcase
- project deployment target: vercel
- Web IDE

## Lean manufacturing models - 3:18, 2024-10-31

- just-in-time manufacturing
  - smaller batches
  - los materiales se compran justo antes de que se necesiten
  - los inventarios de productos terminados se mantienen bajos
- theory of constraints
  - what is holding it back
- **increasing cadence**
  - more frequent and smaller changes
  - get features to users more quickly
  - improved quality and stability
  - reduce the delta, i.e. the amount of change in each release
  - easier to fix bugs when there are smaller changes
  - hotfixes just go out with the next scheduled deployment

## Continuous integration - 5:15, 2024-10-31

- an automated system
- merge right after the changes are complete
- alternative is where some poor developer is tasked with combining all the changes into one deployment
- you need to QA every change as soon as it's ready to merge
- require that a test is passed before code can be merged
- driven by when the work is ready
- los cambios principales se han fusionado a lo largo del sprint.
- las pruebas más caras deberían ser las últimas
- testing
  - syntax testing and linting - making sure the text of your code is valid and conform
  - unit testing - individual functions, components, APIs
  - integration testing - whether specific functions, components, APIs work correctly together
  - end-to-end testing - test the application as the user experiences it, all the real-world scenarios that your code might encounter
- your tests should happen in a pipeline
- find out if there is something broken within minutes of submitting your merge request
- fail early and often
- quit as soon as something goes wrong
- quickly fix issue and retest
- put time and effort into comprehensive tests

## Creating a pipeline, 3:34, 2024-10-31

- I don't have a template like he does
  - ok, I have to choose, on the left: Build > Pipelines
  - use **Bash template**
  - will be using built-in containers in this course
  - you don't need containers, you could deploy to a cloud service
  - before_script is a global section
  - test1 and test2 run in parallel
  - deploy at end
  - doesn't make changes at the moment
  - main branch and commit changes

## Running your pipeline, 2:43, 2024-10-31

- click on the hash to go to pipeline
- can click on rerun icon
- regardless of which you click on, they all go to same logs
- rerunning my second test, it failed

## Going deeper with pipelines, 5:05, 2024-10-31

- there is no interaction between the stages
- I don't have lint button
- edit pipeline
- "file.txt" assumes root of repository

```
- stages:
  - "build"
  - "test"
  - "deploy"
```

- and then this:

```
build1:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Do your build here"
    - echo "this is a file"|tee file.txt
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - "file.txt"

test1:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "Do a test here"
    - echo "For example run a test suite"
    - cat file.txt
  dependencies:
    - "build1"
```

- he advises to start with basic pipelines

## Adding a test, 6:32, 2024-10-31

- testing this:

```
test1:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "testing for string 'gitlab'"
    - grep "gitlab" file.txt
  dependencies:
    - "build1"
```

- worked, test1 failed, but it didn't show exactly where
- now adding variable
- it's not clear if there is one pipeline or many
- can't see where he added the variable to override
- my variable in settings/CICD didn't work
- he has "Run pipeline"
- I have "New pipeline" same place, same button
- okay, but "New pipeline" goes to "Run pipeline" page
- great, it worked then

```
image: busybox:latest

variables:
  MY_WORD2: "gitlab"

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

before_script:
  - echo "note_beforescript"

after_script:
  - echo "note_afterscript"

build1:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "note_build1"
    - echo "$APP_TITLE"
    - echo "this is a file $MY_WORD2"|tee file.txt
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - "file.txt"

test1:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "note_test"
    - echo "testing for string 'gitlab'"
    - grep "gitlab" file.txt
  dependencies:
    - "build1"

test2:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "note_test2"
    - echo "Do another parallel test here"
    - echo "For example run a lint test"

deploy1:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "note_deploy"
  environment: production
```

## Generate a website, 3:48, 2024-10-31

- now a more realistic example
- create markdown file: website.md
- `image: alpine:latest`, it can do more than busybox
- this works:

```
image: alpine:latest

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

render_website:
  stage: build
  script:
    - apk add markdown
    - markdown website.md | tee index.html
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - "index.html"

test_website:
  stage: test
  script:
    - apk add libxml2-utils
    - xmllint --html index.html
  dependencies:
    - "render_website"

deploy_website:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "note_deploy"
  environment: production
```

## CD concepts, 5:26, 2024-10-31

- continuous delivery happens in an environment
- environment
  - standalone hardware and software stack
  - can run entire application
  - configured for a specific purpose
    - development
      - developer's laptop
      - one development environment per developer
      - easily repared or replaced if broken
      - if they delete data in the database by mistake, they should be able to quickly restore it
    - QA
      - intended for testing
      - similar to production
      - usually has only dummy data
    - staging
      - a clone of production
      - matches as closely as possible to production
      - including data in database as long as it doesn't violate privacy laws
      - point is to test something in production without releasing it in production
    - production
      - customer-facing servers
      - also automated testing in prod
      - should be easy to roll back if there is a problem
- code promotion
  - your environments correlate to your branches
  - GitFlow
    - dev and QA is where feature branches can be developed and tested
    - long-running development branch
    - dev branch is deployed to QA
    - push to release branch and tagged
    - pushed to prod

## Environments, 6:43, 2024-11-01

- creates new user with IAM server
- you get an access key ID and a secret access key##accessandsec
- sets up a bucket
- in GitLab he creates a new environment and calls it qa##thenwissinew

## Environment variables, 4:28, 2024-11-01

- settings > ci/cd > variables
- adds variables for AWS
- build > pipeline editor
- creates variable: S3_BUCKET
- in render_website, adds `mkdir -p public`
- deploy_website
  - `apk add aws-cli`
  - `aws s3 cp ./public/ s3://$S3_BUCKET/ --recursive`
  - `dependencies:`
    - `render_website`

## First deployment pipeline, 5:22, 2024-11-01

- view pipeline
- it was deployed
- changes name from `deploy_website` to `deploy_qa`
- every commit to our repo will trigger a deployment
  - so we will add a rules section to the deploy job

```
rules:
  - when: manual
```

- adds `deploy_staging`
- adds job-level variable
- now he has three deploy jobs##nowhas3deploy

## Automating deployments, 5:40, nnn

https://www.linkedin.com/learning/continuous-integration-and-continuous-delivery-with-gitlab/automating-deployments?resume=false

- replaces 'when manual' with: if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == "main"
- @@1:11

it may be tempting to create

so let's take a look

un par de cosas que quiero señalar

we will leave these unset

this is because it is very difficult to distinguish
esto se debe a que es muy difícil distinguir

it is assumed that
se supone que

this concept helps to emphasize
Este concepto ayuda a enfatizar

let's drink to software development
brindemos por el desarrollo de software; [day-sah-ROY-yoh]

it consists of the following parts
es consta de las siguientes partes; [see-g|ee-EN-tays]
